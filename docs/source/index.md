Welcome to the Windows Development Documentation. This is a collection of documents outline how to develop on Windows. Going through shortcuts, applications and approaches to certain tasks when development applications in various technologies.

The aim here is to make it easy for developers familiar with the Unix environment to get to know how Windows does things. Since these are my approaches, the documentation is heavily opinionated.

> Note: These docs are far from complete!
